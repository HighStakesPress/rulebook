\newpage


\begin{dedication}
\small Special thanks to Professor Amy Fisher, our patron, editor, research advisor, and perpetual source of motivation for this entire project. American Sunset couldn't have happened without her, and she's helped us in too many ways to count. Amy took a risk believing in us, and we couldn't be more thankful for it.

\hfill

\small Edgar would like to thank his friends, especially the RPG group from freshman year, without which he definitely never would have found himself working on this project.

\hfill

\small Zeb would like to thank the friends he first played DnD with all those years ago, both his sisters, and anyone he's coerced into playing an RPG with him.

\hfill

\small Wolky would like to thank the University of Puget Sound Science, Technology, and Society department, and especially Kristin Johnson for helping us get started on turning our idea into an a
accredited class, his friends for all the ideas he let them bounce off of him, the community of interested people at the University of Puget Sound, and his mother.

\hfill

\small Jordan would like to personally thank his professors (especially Julie Christoph and Mike Benveniste), his family, his friends, and Natalie de Gyarfas.

\hfill

\small We'd also like to extend thanks to all our playtesters, who took time out of their busy schedules every Tuesday night to test the game with us, even when we weren't sure if it was fun yet.
