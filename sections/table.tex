\section{A letter sent from the City of Silver Springs, May 12, 1872}

\indent To my dearest cousin Adrienne, 

\hfill

I am overjoyed to learn that you've made the choice to travel out West and live here with me in the city of Silver Springs. The clear, clean air of the West has breathed into me a new vigor, and I eagerly await the chance to share this beautiful country with another member of our family.

As you well know, I'm not inclined to work of the physical sort, on account of my injury from the War of the Rebellion, but here it seems opportunities are around every corner. Of late, I have taken up employment with the newspaper. The owner, Elias Reach, is a man ravenous for the next day's headlines. 

 You would hardly believe the drivel he asks me to report upon- The way he tells it, talk of monstrous beasts and secret societies is the only thing that sells a paper, unless we are lucky enough for some poor fools to be beset by a train robbery or, and I have heard him speak wistfully of this, a fire like the one of ten years past.
	
It would be dishonest of me to claim that this city is a safe place to live. Just this last Tuesday I nearly witnessed the killing of a man over the price of a drink. In the summer, the heat could be likened to living inside a coal stove, and in the winters the air itself seems to freeze solid. To the North there are vast forests yet unmapped, to the West there are mountains as full of silver as they are bandits, and to the South lies a desert populated by little more than stones, lizards, and the ghosts of foolish prospectors.

Still, my time here has given me a perspective of this land that I would have otherwise never seen. There is something special about the men and women who choose to brave the frontier here, as if they were painted with brighter colors than the gray, forgettable people back East. Their names roll off my tongue as easily as the names of our own family members now, though there are some I've scarcely met! The river that flows past our city is a magnificent thing, hidden in canyons and valleys, and I cannot give justice to the sunsets, which are awash in colors that by my reckoning even a master painter would be hard pressed to reproduce.

I, and the frontier as well, eagerly await your arrival.

\hfill

With love and anticipation, your cousin Ambrose
