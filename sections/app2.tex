\chapter{Appendix II: Characters and Antagonists}

This section is all about creating characters for players to interact with in the world of American Sunset, both mechanically and conceptually.

\section{Antagonists}\label{Antagonists}\index{Antagonists}
Antagonists in American Sunset are different from player characters. Some are weaker, either because they can take less wounds, have less skills, or lack a vital capability like Reputation. Others are roughly equivalent to player characters of varying levels, sometimes even with the ability to use Reputation traits. Others still are stronger than player characters, they might have unachievable levels of skill or special weapons and rhetorical strategies unavailable to players. Some may be able to safely sustain additional wounds, or wield abilities completely alien to players, born of mystery rather than reputation.

\paragraph{Injury Track} Minor characters and minions have a combined Injury track rather than distinct Wound and Strain tracks. Whenever a character with an Injury track suffers either a Wound or Strain, an injury of the same severity is allocated to their Injury track.

\paragraph{Human Antagonists}

There are 3 different types of human antagonists in American Sunset: Minions, Elites, and Reputable Antagonists. 

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Minions} are the goons and lackeys employed by the setting's powerful characters. Minions are usually unskilled, cheaply paid, and expendable. They only have one Injury track, with 3 Light Injury and 2 Medium Injury boxes.

\item \textbf{Elites} are the specialists, the professionals. They are hired more infrequently than minions, and are much more reliable. An Elite character is equivalent to a starting character in their effectiveness.  A good Antagonist will ensure that an Elite accompanies every group of minions to keep them in line. Elites only have one Injury Track, with 3 Light Injury boxes, 2 Medium Injury boxes, and 1 Severe Injury box.
 
\item \textbf{Reputable Antagonists} are the movers and shakers of American Sunset. They pull the strings, pay the bills, and run the show. Reputable Antagonists are antagonists which have Reputation Aspects, Reputation Points, and a Reputation Rating. Reputable Antagonists may Initiate 2 Contests per turn, and calculate their Wound and Strain tracks like player characters (although the GM is free to fudge this as they wish).

\end{itemize}

Bandits are sometimes ex-soldiers and outcasts, and othertimes just plain mean. They usually ride together and don't attack tough looking people.

\begin{description}
\item[Skills] Fighting 4, Awareness 4, Fitness 3, Intimidate 3, Grit 2.
\end{description}
\tcblower

These folks are barely human and eke out their existence on the fringes of society. Many of them are deranged and prefer to eat their meat raw. Watch out for them, unless you want to become their next meal. 
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Laborer]


\begin{description}
\item[Skills] Handiness 3, Grit 3, Fitness 3, Intimidate 2, Fighting 2, Perform 2, Shooting 1, Medical 1.
\end{description}

These folks do the hard jobs on the frontier and most are uneducated. They don't want trouble, but come to the aid of friends and family.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Nurse]


\begin{description}
\item[Skills] Medical 3, Poise 3, Education 2.
\end{description}
\tcblower

Nurses are doctor's assistants, but are likely stuck at hospitals and clinics during the graveyard shift when no one else is on call. They see the goriest face of the West, and work for little pay.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Merchant]

\item[Skills] Stealth 3, Sleight of Hand 3, Awareness 3, Fighting 2, Shooting 2, Rope Skills 2, Poise 1, Grit 1, Fitness 1.
\end{description}
\tcblower

These people are muggers, ruffians, thieves, and other individuals that live off of the work of others. Unlike bandits who attack travelers in force, skulkers lurk around cities trying to keep their identities secret. They are often willing to accept money to do unsavory things.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Settler]


\begin{description}
\item[Skills] Grit 3, Handiness 3, Fitness 3, Awareness 2, Poise 2, Empathy 2, Medical 2, Shooting 1, Riding 1, Rope Skills 1.
\end{description}
\tcblower

Settlers are hard working people that have taken a risk moving out west, or grew up here. They can be found on farms and ranches, starting or growing families. They are quick to defend what's theirs, and loyal to their friends and family to a fault.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Tradesman/Tradeswoman]


\begin{description}
\item[Skills] Handiness 3, Empathy 3, Rope Skills 3, Poise 2, Grit 2, Medical 2.

These people are dedicated to their craft, whatever it may be. Usually the products of apprenticeships or family businesses, tradespeople can be found in every settlement on the frontier, crafting and trading their wares.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Tribesman/Tribeswoman]

\begin{description}
\item[Skills] Handiness 3, Awareness 3, Medical 3, Fitness 2, Rope Skills 2, Riding 2, Survival 2 Empathy 1, Poise 1, Grit 1
\end{description}
\tcblower

The Native American tribespeople are a hardy lot. They have endured the colonization of their home by uncaring and unending settlers, and it seems that their suffering will not abate anytime soon. Above all, they are self-sufficient and mobile, preferring to migrate rather than settle.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Vigilante]


\begin{description}
\item[Skills] Shooting 3, Fighting 3, Grit 3, Intimidate 3, Awareness 3, Poise 2, Fitness 2, Rope Skills 2.
\end{description}
\tcblower

Vigilantes work outside of the law to enforce justice, and see themselves as good individuals who step in where the law cannot. Many of them have some kind of hatred for lawbreakers, and competently defend themselves in times of stress. They are usually unwilling to attack good citizens. 
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title = U.S. Army Ensign]


\begin{description}
\item[Skills] Shooting 4, Fighting 3, Awareness 3, Fitness 3, Poise 2, Grit 2, Rope Skills 1, Medical 1. 
\end{description}
\tcblower

Like any soldier, ensigns are competent shooters and many of them have something to prove. They represent the U.S. government and its ideals, and will come to the aid of good people if they can. They usually have orders to attack Natives and have a distrust of Enochites.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Elites}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Line Infantry Officer]

\begin{description}
\item[Skills] Shooting 5, Empathy 4, Poise 4, Fitness 3, Grit 3, Awareness 3, Survival 2, Riding 2, Intimidate 2, Education 2, Medical 1, Deception 1, Rope Skill 1, Handiness 1.
\end{description}
\tcblower

Army officers are experienced individuals who served during the Civil War. They have witnessed countless atrocities, led their men in suicidal charges, and lived to tell the tale.
\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Assassin]

\begin{description}
\item[Skills]  Shooting 5, Stealth 4, Fighting 4, Sleight of Hand 3, Awareness 3, Riding 3, Rope Skill 2, Education 2, Medical 2, Survival 2, Fitness 1, Deception 1, Poise 1, Grit 1.
\end{description}
\tcblower

Assassins are professional killers, trained to execute their targets without being noticed. They are highly valued individuals whose skill set often finds a employment in the West. Some have a moral code, but many are only bound to their contract and the pay they receive.

\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Bandero]

\begin{description}
\item[Skills] Grit 5, Shooting 4, Intimidate 4, Riding 3, Awareness 3, Rope Skill 3, Empath 2, Sleight of Hand 2, Survival 2, Stealth 2, Handiness 1, Perform 1.
\end{description}
\tcblower

Banderos are expert Mexican soldiers who have served their time and moved on. With Mexico crumbling while America expands, many Banderos have become hired guns, and sell their services to the highest bidder. 
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Bounty Hunter]

\begin{description}
\item[Skills] Shooting 5, Survival 4, Stealth 4, Poise 3, Intimidate 3, Awareness 3, Riding 2, Medical 2, Rope Skill 2, Empathy 2, Handiness 1, Perform 1, Deception 1, Grit 1.
\end{description}
\tcblower

Bounty Hunters have a job, and they are loathe to let anyone get in their way. Bounty Hunters can be found in shady saloons, looking for their next mark. Many Bounty Hunters are ex-soldiers, and learned their arts from the military. Motivated only by pay, they're nonetheless the closest some settlements get to a force of law.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Cavalry Officer]

\begin{description}
\item[Skills]  Riding 5, Fighting 5, Poise 4, Empathy 4, Fitness 3, Grit 3, Awareness 3, Survival 2, Intimidate 2, Education 1, Medical 1, Deception 1, Rope Skill 1, Handiness 1.
\end{description}
\tcblower

Cavalry Officers are seen as glorious, heroic individuals by most Americans. Their imposing, mounted stature cuts a strong figure, and they are known for their ruthlessness. The prestige of General Adrian Steele has trickled down to these lowly officers, but so has his brutality and his cunning. By virtue of their stature, Cavalry Officers consider themselves privileged above all others, and few would dispute this. 
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Cult Leader]

\begin{description}
\item[Skills] Empathy 5, Education 4, Deception 4, Poise 3, Medical 3, Grit 3, Stealth 2, Riding 2, Rope Skill 2, Survival 2, Handiness 1, Perform 1, Awareness 1.
\end{description}
\tcblower

The West is a strange place, with even stranger people. Cult Leaders are charismatic, educated individuals who know how to manage their flock. The distinction between Cult Leaders and priests can be semantic if you don't look too closely, but looking too close at some people's beliefs can be a danger in its own right.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Distinguished Warrior]

\begin{description}
\item[Skills]  Riding 5, Fighting 5, Shooting 4, Awareness 4, Stealth 3, Fitness 3, Grit 3, Empathy 2, Intimidate 2, Perform 2, Poise 1, Rope Skill 1, Education 1.
\end{description}
\tcblower

The Confederacy of the Hawk's lifestyle lends itself to the creation of hardened veterans. Their elite warriors compose the bodyguard of the Starhawks' retinue, and they are fiercely loyal to him. They ride quickly, and frequently accompany raiding bands.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Doctor]

\begin{description}
\item[Skills]  Medical 5, Poise 4, Education 4, Awareness 3, Handiness 3, Empath 3, Grit 2, Intimidate 2, Shooting 2, Fitness 2, Deception 2.
\end{description}
\tcblower

Doctors are the lucky, educated few who have their own practice. They likely employ a number of nurses and see to the needs of an entire town. Doctors are scarce on the frontier, but they are well-loved by their patients.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Politician]

\begin{description}
\item[Skills]  Poise 5, Deception 5, Empathy 5, Intimidate 3, Education 3, Awareness 3, Riding 2, Sleight of Hand 2, Stealth 2, Handiness 1.
\end{description}
\tcblower

Politicians are good at their job--- almost too good. For a politician, their career is a lifestyle. Every public appearance is a show, and every secret is a weapon against the shameful. They are manipulative, shrewd, and conniving by nature, but a few might a sense of decency and honor if you dig deep enough.
\end{tcolorbox}


\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Priest (Christian)]


\begin{description}
\item[Skills]  Empathy 6, Poise 4, Education 4, Awareness 3, Intimidate 3, Grit 3, Deception 2, Medical 2, Handiness 2, Perform 2, Fighting 1.
\end{description}
\tcblower

For a Christian, the priesthood is an ancient tradition, stretching back to the Levant. Priests are highly trusted by their laity, like the flock trusts the shepherd. This trust is usually well placed, but the West is a godforsaken place, and it can corrupt even the purest souls.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Priest (Native)]

\begin{description}
\item[Skills]  Awareness 6, Empathy 4, Medical 4, Intimidate 3, Poise 3, Grit 3, Education 2, Perform 2, Survival 2, Stealth 2, Riding 1, Sleight of Hand 1, Shooting 1.
\end{description}
\tcblower

Native priests local to Jefferson come from one of three orders: Priests of the Raven, Magpie, and Vulture. While the orders have always kept the peace between each other, the end times are upon their people, and mistrust is taking hold. It is all some priests can do but walk with dignity alongside their tribe into their final days.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Priest (Enochite)]

\begin{description}
\item[Skills]  Poise 6, Intimidate 4, Deception 4, Medical 3, Education 3, Grit 3, Awareness 2, Riding 2, Sleight of Hand 2, Shooting 2, Stealth 2, Perform 1.
\end{description}
\tcblower

Enochite Priests, much like Christian priests, are leaders to their people, spiritual and otherwise. Outside of their communities, they are met with suspicion and their words often go unheeded, but inside their tight-knit settlements, they are as family. 
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Sheriff]
\begin{description}
\item[Skills]  Intimidate 5, Shooting 5, Awareness 5, Poise 3, Rope Skill 3, Grit 3, Riding 2, Medical 2, Education 2, Fighting 2, Stealth 1, Handiness 1, Deception 1, Perform 1.
\end{description}
\tcblower

Sheriffs are the underpaid, overworked lawmen in the West. They will often hire vigilante committees to aid in exercising justice, though any sheriff worth his salt knows that sometimes the only person can trust is yourself.
