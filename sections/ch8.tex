\chapter{Gear}\label{Gear}

\chapterimage{Great_Plains_1x2.jpg} % Chapter heading image



\lettrine[lines=2]{T}{his} section details all manner of items and equipment a well-prepared character might be carrying. That means the mechanical details for weapons, which are a major subset of gear, as well as the mechanics and prices for buying everything from food to clothing to weapons. Though we provide suggestions, prices for items are ultimately at the GM's discretion. 

Starting Gear is classified as one of three types of item: 

\begin{description}
\item[Kit Items], which are required to perform a task.
\item[Personal Effects] and items that are part of your character's history or backstory.
\item[Weapons], which are any item used in combat.
\end{description}

\section{Optional Gear Rules} 
\paragraph{Multiple Currencies}
The American Sunset system allows for multiple different items to be treated as units of currency, with prices of conversion listed below, if you want to use these you'll need to track them. This rule is optional because it requires more information that players and game masters need to track, but it can lead to more depth in the economy when different characters players encounter are more willing to accept different currencies.


\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Alternate Currencies]
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf {Silver} & \$1.30 per oz\\
\textbf {Gold} & \$20 per oz\\
\textbf {Bullets} & \$0.05 each\\
